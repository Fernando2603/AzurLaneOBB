# AzurLaneOBB

Contains Azur Lane extracted OBB data downloaded from `APKPure`. Currently, only the `EN` server is supported.

> [!TIP]
> The repository will check for updates every month.


## Why does this repository exist?

This repository primarily supports my latest project on Azur Lane painting reconstruction, allowing asset retrieval directly from the server.

Since downloading assets within the OBB by requesting them directly from the game server is not possible (it returns an error), this repository was created to facilitate the process.
